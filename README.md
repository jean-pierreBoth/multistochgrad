# multistochgrad

This crate provides a Rust implementation of some stochastic gradient algorithms.

* The so-called SCSG algorithm described and analyzed in the two papers by by L. Lei and  M.I Jordan.

    1. "On the adaptativity of stochastic gradient based optimization" (2019)
    [SCSG-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04480)

    2. "Less than a single pass : stochastically controlled stochastic gradient" (2019)
    [SCSD-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03261)

* The SVRG algorithm described in the paper by R. Johnson and T. Zhang
"Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction" (2019).

## Building

By default the crate is a standalone project and builds a static libray and executable.
To be used with the companion Julia package it is necessary to build a dynamic library.
This can be done by just uncommenting (i.e get rid of the #) in file Cargo.toml the line:

*#crate-type = ["dylib"]*

and rerun the command: cargo build --release.

This will generate a .so file in the target/release directory.
